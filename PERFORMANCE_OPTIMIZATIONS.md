- ✅ **X-Frame-Options** - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- ✅ **X-Content-Type-Options** - Prevents MIME sniffing
- ✅ **X-XSS-Protection** - Additional XSS protection
- ✅ **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP)** - Proper origin isolation
- ✅ **Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP)** - Credentialless mode
- ✅ **Referrer-Policy** - Controls referrer information
- ✅ **Permissions-Policy** - Restricts camera/microphone/geolocation
- ✅ **X-DNS-Prefetch-Control** - Enables DNS prefetching

## 🎯 SEO Improvements (Target: 91 → 100)

### Meta Tags & SEO:
- ✅ Meta description already present (verified)
- ✅ Added robots.txt file
- ✅ Added sitemap.xml file
- ✅ Added manifest.json for PWA
- ✅ Added theme-color meta tag
- ✅ Proper Open Graph tags configured
- ✅ Twitter Card tags configured
- ✅ Canonical URLs set

## ♿ Accessibility (Already Perfect)
- ✅ Score: 100/100 - No changes needed
- ✅ Added aria-hidden to decorative elements

## 📱 Mobile-Specific Optimizations (NEW)

### Performance Improvements:
- ✅ **Stars hidden on mobile** - Reduces DOM elements from 10 to 0 on mobile
- ✅ **PatternedBackground hidden on mobile** - Eliminates heavy SVG rendering
- ✅ **Animations disabled on mobile** - No gradient animations, pulse effects
- ✅ **Reduced backdrop blur complexity** - From blur(20px) to blur(8px)
- ✅ **Throttled scroll events** - Using requestAnimationFrame for better performance
- ✅ **Passive event listeners** - Scroll events marked as passive
- ✅ **Scroll indicator hidden on mobile** - Reduces unnecessary DOM/animations
- ✅ **Removed will-change on mobile** - Reduces GPU memory usage

### SEO Fixes:
- ✅ **Explicit meta description** - Added directly in head tag (not just metadata export)
- ✅ **Viewport meta tag** - Proper viewport configuration for mobile
- ✅ **Semantic HTML** - Added id="home" to hero section

### JavaScript Optimization:
- ✅ **Dynamic imports** - ModernNavbar loaded with Next.js dynamic()
- ✅ **SSR enabled** - Navbar rendered on server for faster FCP
- ✅ **Deferred animations** - 100ms delay before triggering hero animations

### Expected Mobile Improvements:
- **LCP**: 7.4s → ~2.0s (removing heavy animations and backgrounds)
- **TBT**: 340ms → ~100ms (throttled events, passive listeners)
- **SEO**: 68 → 100 (explicit meta description)
- **Performance**: Should maintain 95-100

## 📊 Expected Lighthouse Score Improvements

| Metric | Before | After (Expected) | Improvement |
|--------|--------|------------------|-------------|
| Performance | 97 | 99+ | +2 points |
| Accessibility | 100 | 100 | No change |
| Best Practices | 91 | 100 | +9 points |
| SEO | 91 | 100 | +9 points |

## 🎨 Core Web Vitals Improvements

- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Improved via font optimization and reduced CSS
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Improved via lazy loading and caching
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**: Already 0ms - maintained
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Already 0 - maintained
- **Speed Index**: Improved via CSS optimization and lazy loading

## 📝 Key Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `next.config.ts` - Added comprehensive optimizations and security headers
2. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Optimized font loading, reduced DOM elements
3. `src/app/page.tsx` - Implemented lazy loading for below-fold components
4. `src/app/globals.css` - Removed 450+ lines of unused CSS
5. `package.json` - Removed turbopack from build (for stability)

### Files Created:
1. `public/robots.txt` - SEO crawling instructions
2. `public/sitemap.xml` - Site structure for search engines
3. `public/manifest.json` - PWA manifest

## 🚦 Next Steps to Verify

Run these commands to verify the improvements:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build the optimized version
yarn build

# Start production server
yarn start

# Then run Lighthouse again to see improvements
```

## 💡 Additional Recommendations

1. **Image Optimization**: If you add images later, use Next.js `<Image>` component with AVIF/WebP formats
2. **Code Splitting**: Consider route-based code splitting for larger pages
3. **Analytics**: Consider adding Web Vitals monitoring
4. **CDN**: Deploy to Vercel or similar edge network for optimal performance
5. **Monitoring**: Set up continuous Lighthouse CI for ongoing performance tracking

## 🔧 Build Command Changes

The build now uses standard Next.js build (without turbopack) for better optimization and stability in production. Development still uses turbopack for fast refresh.
